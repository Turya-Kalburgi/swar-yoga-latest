# 🎉 DATA NOT SAVING - DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE

## ✅ WHAT I FOUND

Your **life planner**, **admin panel**, and **workshop data** aren't saving because your **Node.js backend isn't deployed to production**.

---

## 🎯 THE FIX (In 3 Steps)

```
STEP 1: Deploy Backend to Render (5 min)
   └→ Go to render.com → Create Web Service → Deploy

STEP 2: Update Frontend API URL (2 min)
   └→ Edit src/utils/database.ts → Change one line

STEP 3: Push & Deploy (1 min + 5 auto)
   └→ git push → Vercel auto-deploys (5 min)

TOTAL TIME: ~13 minutes
RESULT: Everything saves ✅
```
