## ⚠️ BEFORE YOU CHANGE

**Important consideration:**

```
You already shared credentials publicly!

EITHER WAY you deploy:
1. Render ← Current plan
2. Railway ← Alternative
3. Heroku ← Alternative
4. Any other ← Your choice

YOU MUST:
1. Regenerate Supabase keys FIRST! 🚨
2. Revoke old credentials
3. Use new credentials
4. Then deploy anywhere

The security fix is THE SAME regardless!
```
