## ✅ VERIFICATION STEPS

5. **Redeploy**
   - Hover over: Latest deployment
   - Click: Three dots (...) menu
   - Select: "Redeploy"
   - Or click: "Redeploy from main" button at top

## 📝 AUTOMATIC WORKFLOW (Going Forward)

### You don't need to do anything extra!

```
1. Make changes on your computer
   (Add workshop, update prices, etc.)

2. Push to GitHub
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Update: Description"
   git push origin main

3. Vercel automatically:
   - Gets notification from GitHub
   - Pulls latest code
   - Builds React app
   - Deploys to swaryoga.com

4. Your site updates automatically ✅
   Wait 2-5 minutes and check!
```
